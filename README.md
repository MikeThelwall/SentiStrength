SentiStrength sentiment strength detection

The Java jar in this folder Sentistrength.jar is the commercial version. Please email Mike Thelwall for a licence (£1000) before using this for commercial purposes, except testing:

The Windows SentiStrength2.3Free.exe can be used for any purpose. More information will be on the SentiStrength website sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk when it is up again (down in early 2024).

Both Java and Windows versions must be used with the text files extracted from the zip file SentiStrengthDataEnglishOctober2019.zip

There is no JavaDoc but there is a brief manual for the Java version
SentiStrengthJavaManual.doc

The other zipfiles are mostly language resources for other language versions of SentiStrength.

The other Java jars are:
TensiStrength.jar (free for academic use, £1000 for commercial use, with SentiStrength), use it with the files extracted from TensiStrength_Data.zip
PeerJudgeProg.jar (free for academic use, £1000 for commercial use, with SentiStrength), use it with the files extracted from PeerJudgeLookupTables.zip
The information in SentiStrengthJavaManual.doc is mostly applicable to both TensiStrength.jar and PeerJudgeProg.jar.
